      <p>
        Pleasure to meet you. You've reached my little corner of the internet, a
        place where I (hope to) actively maintain an online representation of
        myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a current undergraduate at Purdue University, majoring in Computer
        Science with minor in Mathematics. Over the two years I've been here, I
        have developed a keen interest in systems and graphics programming,
        leading me to pursue concentrations in both of these fields. I am also a
        fan of graph theory – algorithms, optimizations,
